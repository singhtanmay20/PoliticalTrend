Come back every Friday for new suggestions on what to watch.‘Barry’When to watch: Sunday at 10 p.m., on HBOThis brutal and hilarious assassin comedy is back for its second season, and it picks up soon after the Season 1 finale, in which Barry killed his mentor’s detective girlfriend when she uncovered his criminal connections. Hader won an Emmy for his work last season, and he should probably win another for this go-round. There’s decency somewhere within Barry’s hard and violent self, and Hader never lets the audience lose sight of those tiny flickers of tenderness.‘Veep’When to watch: Sunday at 10:30 p.m., on HBOTime for one last hail to the chief. The seventh and final season of “Veep” arrives Sunday, filthy and festive as ever. Selina is back on the campaign trail, where haplessness and maneuvering abound in equal measure. “Veep” is a show that works moment to moment, scene to scene, so if you don’t remember all the schemes and ups and downs from previous seasons, it doesn’t really matter — the insults and jokes land just fine without remembering the particulars of the Meyer administration.‘Great Performances: Julius Caesar’When to watch: Friday at 9 p.m., on PBS. (Check local listings)This stark interpretation of “Julius Caesar,” directed by Phyllida Lloyd, has an all-female cast and sets its production within a women’s prison, which gives the proceedings an extra dose of fear and tension. Because the production is so bare — and the cinematography for this filmed staging similarly stripped down — all that’s left is a restless rage.Advertisement
