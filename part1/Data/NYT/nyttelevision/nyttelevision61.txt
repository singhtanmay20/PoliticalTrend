Come back every Friday for new suggestions on what to watch.‘Special’ When to watch: Starting Friday, on Netflix.Ryan O’Connell created and stars in this semi-autobiographical series that is basically “Shrill” but about a disabled gay man. He’s learning to accept himself, his sexuality, his cerebral palsy and his … codependency with his mom. Ryan is a blogger, so he and his new BFF at work have zingers for days, but the show has plenty of sweetness to balance its snark. At eight 15-minute episodes, it feels scant, but “Special” packs in an impressive amount of character richness and development, and it doesn’t waste time.‘Game of Thrones’ When to watch: Sunday at 9 p.m., on HBO.Perhaps you’ve heard: “Game of Thrones” is returning for an eighth and final season this weekend. It’s nice to see some friendly or at last familiar faces after such a long break between seasons; the show has been gone for almost two years. The challenge for these final six episodes is that “Thrones” has constantly expanded its story without always advancing it, and tying together anything this sprawling seems almost impossible.‘Queens of Mystery’ When to watch: Now, on Acorn TV.If you like “Pushing Daisies,” this is your next jam. We’ve got a fairy-tale-style omniscient narrator who notes the exact years, months and days since certain events; oddball aunts who raised a bookish niece; and police investigations that are more whimsical than gory. Olivia Vinall plays Matilda, a detective who developed her skills thanks to her aunts’ careers as crime novelists. Acorn is releasing three two-part stories; the first is available now, and the second and third debut on April 15 and 22.Advertisement
