The blockbuster mob series proved that viewers would embrace knotty, ambitious TV serials, clearing the way for not just other antihero tales, like “Deadwood” and “Breaking Bad,” but also other challenging series like “Atlanta” and “Transparent.”So we couldn’t let the anniversary pass without reconsidering “The Sopranos” and its impact.David Chase, on the other hand, doesn’t exactly jump at the chance to look back. “I thought revisiting the show would be more pleasurable,” the creator told The New York Times. “But it turns out I’ve forgotten a lot more than I thought I would.”Edie Falco, who starred as Carmela Soprano, is likewise a little worn out by the constant reflection. “I haven’t heard a new question about ‘The Sopranos’ in a long time,” she mused good-naturedly in a separate interview.Thankfully, Chase and Falco were still game to revisit the world of Tony Soprano. In this video, they recall their memories of “The Sopranos” and James Gandolfini, who died in 2013, and discuss the show’s legacy, what made it so special then, and why it endures today. And you better believe we asked them about the endlessly analyzed finale and cut to black.Advertisement
