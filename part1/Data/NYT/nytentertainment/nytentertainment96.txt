But upon taking a closer look, and an honest one, that premise is faulty.Mr. Trump has reached the pinnacle of success in multiple fields. First, he immersed himself in the sharp-elbowed world of New York and international real estate development, building a global brand and becoming a multibillionaire in the process. The Times likes to discredit his wealth by repeatedly stating that his father, Fred, left him just over $400 million in today’s dollars. But according to Forbes, Mr. Trump is today worth around $3.1 billion. That’s a difference of some $2.7 billion, making Mr. Trump, you guessed it, a self-made billionaire.Next, Mr. Trump entered the equally sharp-elbowed world of entertainment, where he once again ascended to the pinnacle of success, becoming the star of a top-rated television show.Finally, Mr. Trump entered perhaps the sharpest elbowed world of them all, Washington politics. And once again, Mr. Trump ascended to the zenith.Three vastly different chosen fields of endeavor. Three remarkable ascents. Given these undeniable realities, it is the height of absurdity for The Times to call Mr. Trump “King Minus Touch.” Michael J. DiStefanoJamestown, R.I. Advertisement
