"There is some concern that real competition is entering the market, but Netflix is still a good proxy for investor risk appetite, especially for technology," said Joel Kulina, Senior Vice President of Institutional Cash Equities at Wedbush Securities.Options traders expect Netflix shares to swing by about 7% in either direction in the session after its report, which is expected after the market closes on Tuesday. That is more than the median move of 5.4% in Netflix's eight most recent quarterly reports, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert.On Jan. 18 following its last quarterly results, Netflix dropped 4% over concerns about slowing growth, and investors are now focused on how Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings plans to fend off a major challenge from Walt Disney, with its upcoming Disney+ streaming service.
