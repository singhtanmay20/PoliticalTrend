"While jewellery, beauty products and clothing purchases were all up to indulge on Mother's Day, shoppers were generally cautious not to overspend, particularly on larger items."Separate figures from payments company Barclaycard covering overall consumer spending - which includes entertainment and travel as well as shopping - were more upbeat.Year-on-year, spending by consumers grew by 3.4 percent last month, the biggest increase since October.Barclaycard said spending at pubs, restaurants and garden centres saw particularly big year-on-year gains, as mild weather this March contrasted with unusually icy weather a year ago.However Brexit continued to be a worry, with 69 percent of consumers Barclaycard surveyed lacking confidence about the economic outlook, the highest since the survey began in 2014."Underlying sentiment is cautious. March was characterised by ongoing uncertainty around Brexit, with consumers concerned about an impact on food prices and supplies," Barclaycard director Esme Harwood said.
