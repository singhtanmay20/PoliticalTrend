One guard was shot in the face, the Age newspaper said. However, there was no suggestion yet that the attack was terror-related, a police spokeswoman said by telephone.Bloodstained clothing and bullet casings littered the street outside the entrance to the second-storey Love Machine nightclub early on Sunday.Police urged witnesses who saw any vehicle moving at speed around 3 a.m. to come forward, and mentioned a black Porsche SUV that was later found burnt-out in the north Melbourne suburb of Wollert.No arrests have yet been made, and investigation continues.A murder-suicide last year in Western Australia that killed seven members of a family was the country's worst mass shooting since the Port Arthur case.Neighbouring New Zealand has adopted legislation to ban semi-automatic firearms and assault rifles after its worst peacetime shooting in March, which killed 50 worshippers in two mosques in the city of Christchurch.
