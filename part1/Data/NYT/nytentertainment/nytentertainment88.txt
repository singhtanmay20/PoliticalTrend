The company, which was founded in 2015, has also just received $4.5 million in a new round of funding.“Marvel has grown to become a lifestyle for every kind of fan around the world, but it all started from serialized storytelling,” said John Nee, the publisher of Marvel Entertainment, in a statement. In addition to Thor, Serial Box will draw from its stable of more than 100 writers to produce stories for Black Panther, Black Widow and Jessica Jones.Serial Box is the brainchild of Molly Barton, who was formerly the global digital director for Penguin Random House and her co-founder Julian Yap. The company applies the television model to books: Series are written by “writers’ rooms” and readers (or listeners — the books are also released in audio form) can purchase an “episode” or an entire “season.” Serial Box has two dozen series available on their platform, ranging from fantasy and sci-fi to mystery or procedurals.“We are really focused on the commute and the idea that people have a short window of time in their day where you can make your content fit that window,” said Barton in a recent call.Having writers work collaboratively allows them to produce content more quickly. “Every time we bring our writers together for a writers’ room to create a new series, one of them will say something like, ‘This process is magical. This would’ve taken me three months alone at my desk to solve this problem that we just talked through in 20 minutes.’”Though yet unannounced, Barton said there are also plans to adapt some of their series to television.Follow Concepción de León on Twitter:  @bycdl.Follow New York Times Books on Facebook and Twitter (@nytimesbooks), sign up for our newsletter or our literary calendar.
