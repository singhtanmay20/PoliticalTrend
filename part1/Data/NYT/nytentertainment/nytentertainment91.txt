The show was capitalized for up to $15 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission; it has not recouped its capitalization costs.The show has an unusually ambitious touring schedule, especially for a musical that was not a huge success on Broadway, where it was greeted with several negative reviews. It is now on tour in the United States and running in Madrid and Stuttgart, Germany; there are runs planned in Holland, Korea, Japan, Mexico, Australia and Brazil.The stage adaptation features music by Stephen Flaherty and lyrics by Lynn Ahrens, whose Oscar-nominated song for the film, “Journey to the Past,” is also featured in the musical. The show has a book by Terrence McNally and is directed by Darko Tresnjak; it had a pre-Broadway production at Hartford Stage, where Mr. Tresnjak is the artistic director.The musical’s weekly grosses, which peaked last Christmas at $1.3 million for a nine-performance week, have dropped to problematic levels — last week the show brought in $508,700 over eight performances, according to figures from the Broadway League.The musical is produced by Stage Entertainment, Bill Taylor, Tom Kirdahy, Hunter Arnold and Dan Hinde.Follow Michael Paulson on Twitter: @MichaelPaulson.Advertisement
