To the Editor:Re “N.R.A.’s Next Target: Violence Against Women Act” (news article, April 2):It’s hard to imagine what the National Rifle Association was thinking by targeting the Violence Against Women Act. Can it truly believe that an angry, jealous, stalking, abusing, assaulting, drunk, dismissed man with a gun isn’t dangerous? Really?Can it really believe that this position will be well received? Can any Republican or Democrat want his or her name associated with this position? In an America where the #MeToo movement has raised the consciousness of everyone, where the names of sexual abusers make headlines, where students are rallying against the use of guns, where parents grieve the loss of children, where places of worship and entertainment are targets of gun violence, the N.R.A.’s position is arrogant, inexcusable and dangerous and needs to be challenged on Capitol Hill and in statehouses across the country.Doris FenigBoca Raton, Fla.Advertisement
