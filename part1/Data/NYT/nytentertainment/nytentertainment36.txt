AdvertisementIn the last two weeks, “Old Town Road,” the viral hit by the rapper Lil Nas X, has become a flash point for conversations about what is, isn’t, or might be country music. The track briefly appeared on the Billboard Top Country Songs chart before being removed after it was deemed insufficiently country. (On Friday, Billy Ray Cyrus joined the track on a remix.)The lines are blurry, but this is far from the first time country music and hip-hop have been in dialogue.
