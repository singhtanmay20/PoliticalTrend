If the streaming service’s recent hit “Bird Box” seemed like an ocular companion to the aural deprivation of “A Quiet Place,” this new film feels like a de facto prequel, catching the apocalyptic moment when hordes of sound-sensitive creatures wipe out the bulk of humanity.For Shane Van Dyke, who wrote the script with his brother Carey, such “mockbuster” enterprises are his business: His credits include off-brand entertainments like “Transmorphers 2” and “Paranormal Entity,” and he even wrote and directed “Titanic II,” a disaster film set on a replica ship 100 years after the original voyage. Here, only a quality cast and more generous production values can cover up the shoddy stitching.Though adapted from a 2015 novel by Tim Lebbon — himself a movie novelization specialist — “The Silence” echoes “A Quiet Place” in most of its particulars, including a deaf child fleeing with her family to a country refuge. Kiernan Shipka, of “Mad Men” fame, acquits herself well as Ally, a teenager whose heightened perception helps her parents (Stanley Tucci and Miranda Otto), grandmother (Kate Trotter) and little brother (Kyle Harrison Breitkopf) escape pterosaur-like carrion called “Vesps.” The family dog has more trouble keeping mum.“The Silence” posits a grand evolutionary struggle between mankind and its winged tormentors, but every moment feels like regression.Movie data powered by IMDb.comThe SilenceNot Rated.
