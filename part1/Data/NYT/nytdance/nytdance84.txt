She was his muse and a ferocious dancer in her own right.The complex, fiery relationship Bob Fosse had with Gwen Verdon is the subject of "Fosse/Verdon ," a new eight-part series on FX starring Sam Rockwell and Michelle Williams.Fosse was the exacting mind behind the angular movements and bowler hats of "Chicago," the brutally autobiographical "All That Jazz" and the dark punch of the film "Cabaret." Verdon won four Tony Awards within six years in the 1950s.Director and executive producer Thomas Kail says the series explores the famous couple but also the nature of artistic creation itself. To make it, he says he tried to mimic Fosse's own visual style and technique.Advertisement
