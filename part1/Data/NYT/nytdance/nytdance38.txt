I don’t know why ballroom dancing is not promoted more for this. Studies have shown that dancing improves strength and balance, and ballroom dancing is fun. It also engages you mentally as you learn the steps and as you constantly adjust to your partner. So take some lessons from a good studio. I have been doing this since I turned 80 four years ago, and though I had previously fallen several times, I have not fallen since I began dancing.Lola KampHighland Park, N.J.Advertisement
