The third dance will be another first for her: a work made to be performed in a museum or gallery space. The plan, she said, is to bring the dance to three or four museums and alter it depending on the space available and the site’s geographical location and history.The residency will also provide an opportunity for Ms. Tanowitz to archive her work. She said she plans to engage with writers and filmmakers to make sure her archive has its own artistic value.Ms. Tanowitz will also be involved with Bard College’s undergraduate students. She and her team will teach, perform and engage with students about the creative process.Advertisement
