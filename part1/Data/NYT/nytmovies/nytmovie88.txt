The city itself doesn’t get a whole lot of consideration, either.There are a couple of stories — one starring Keira Knightley and Helen Mirren, in which Knightley’s character works at a refugee shelter; another starring Alexander Black and Carol Schuler, in which a migrant who’s committed a crime hides out in a brothel — that address contemporary concerns of the city. But most of this movie, which is almost entirely in English, is taken up with tone-deaf humanist tales.Luke Wilson plays a big-budget Hollywood filmmaker whose Sense of Childlike Wonder is revived by a puppet theater run by, you guessed it, a winsome and beautiful woman (Dianna Agron). A miscast Diego Luna plays a trans woman who is both hit on and insulted by a teenage boy who insists that any kiss they share would be a same-sex encounter. Most excruciating is the vignette showing Mickey Rourke, in a hotel bar, crudely hitting on a woman. He’s old enough to be her father, and later speculates that he may indeed be her father. In the movie’s frame story, one character mimes while wearing angel wings clearly inspired by Wim Wenders’s “Wings of Desire,” a Berlin movie infinitely preferable to this one.Movie data powered by IMDb.comRated R for language and ill-advised sexual situations.
