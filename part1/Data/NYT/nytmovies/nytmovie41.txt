One survivor, a French journalist named Mathilde (Emmanuelle Bercot), becomes our guide and occasional narrator as she embeds with the unit and records the women’s stories.Sporting a black eye patch (reminiscent of the British war correspondent Marie Colvin), Mathilde bonds with Bahar (the arresting Golshifteh Farahani), the unit’s commander. She, like all the women, is an escaped ISIS captive who has suffered unspeakable abuse; now their mission is to liberate Bahar’s hometown, where her son remains a hostage. Their unique advantage is the jihadists’ belief that any fighter killed by a woman will be denied entry into heaven.Inspired by a 2014 ISIS raid on Kurdish territory, “Girls of the Sun,” unlike the women who populate it, is weak and often corny. The story is inherently dramatic and the action scenes (sinuously photographed by Mattias Troelstrup) have real punch, but Husson is more interested in exalting her subjects than humanizing them. Inelegant construction and unsubtle, occasionally tub-thumping dialogue further drain the movie’s potency, as do Mathilde’s overripe musings on war and suffering.The granddaughter of a onetime captive Spanish Republican soldier, Husson says in the press notes that she wanted to explore collective trauma and “the notion of lost ideals.” Her good intentions, though, are the movie’s kryptonite; and as we watch flashbacks to Bahar’s happy prewar life, we see the seeds of another, better movie. In Farahani’s gorgeously expressive, silent-film-star face lies the ability to convey more than any amount of journalistic eloquence.When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Movie data powered by IMDb.comNot rated.
