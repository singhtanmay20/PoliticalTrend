Several performers of color won in some of the most prestigious categories, including the night’s best actor in a movie drama, the Egyptian-American star Rami Malek.And the diversity extended to the stories being told. Best animated movie went to “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,” in which a version of the superhero is an Afro-Latino teenager. (The directing team behind the movie included an African-American filmmaker, Peter Ramsey.) Best comedy went to “Green Book,” about the relationship between an African-American pianist and his Italian-American driver.One winner, Darren Criss, spoke onstage about the issue, noting, “This has been a marvelous year for representation in Hollywood, and I am so enormously proud to be a teeny, tiny part of that as the son of a firecracker Filipino woman from Cebu that dreamed of coming to this country and getting to be invited to cool parties like this.”Here’s a rundown of the artists of color who took home trophies Sunday:Alfonso Cuarón (“Roma.”): Best director for a motion picture.Regina King (“If Beale Street Could Talk”): Best performance by a supporting role in any movie.Mahershala Ali (“Green Book”): Best performance by an actor in a supporting role in any movie.Sandra Oh (“Killing Eve”): Best performance by an actress in a television drama series.Rami Malek (“Bohemian Rhapsody”): Best performance by an actor in a movie dramaDarren Criss (“The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story”): Best performance by an actor in a limited series or a television movie.Advertisement
