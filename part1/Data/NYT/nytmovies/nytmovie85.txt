Hence, there have been a whole lot of “Ip Man” movies since. Some feature Yen, some don’t. This one has him on board as a producer only, and it’s a lively, fun one.Ip Man himself was a real martial arts master of the Wing Chun style who trained Bruce Lee, among others. This movie’s lead character, Cheung Tin-chi, is based on an actual person who was so thoroughly fictionalized in “Ip Man 3” (2016) that here he can roam free in a made-up story set in a fanciful period Hong Kong.Played with quiet charisma and notably high cheekbones by Max Zhang, Cheung has renounced fighting and runs a small grocery while looking after his young son. (That he’s a single dad is practically a given in this genre.) After running afoul of an opium den proprietor, he’s back to jumping and kicking and smashing.He is soon up against a gang leader who’s trying to go legit (Michelle Yeoh, in fine fettle) and a Western restaurateur with a secret (Dave Bautista, acquitting himself well), among others.Directed by Yuen Woo-ping, the 74-year-old stunt and choreography master who brought his fight mojo to “The Matrix,” “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” and both volumes of “Kill Bill,” “Master Z” does a lot of things you hope it will — mainly in serving up inventive fight sequences. It also doesn’t do a few things that you hope it won’t, like serve up Cheung’s young son as a life-endangered prop.When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Movie data powered by IMDb.comNot rated.
