To me, though, they’re something else entirely: cracked symphonies of anguish and humiliation.What distinguishes Potrykus is his willingness to force this pain — as he did with “Ape” in 2014 and, a year later, “Buzzard” — to the point where our initial revulsion for a character transforms into compassion. Abbie (Joshua Burge) in “Relaxer,” is a perfect example: a thin, pale, Pac-Man-playing dude (it’s 1999) parked on a scabby couch in a roach-infested apartment. There he’ll stay for the duration, having accepted a deranged challenge from his sadistically abusive brother (David Dastmalchian).As the story progresses and Abbie’s condition deteriorates in harmony with his surroundings, we see that the horror-movie music that opens the movie was far from arbitrary. Visitors stop by, but they’re mostly instruments of further torment, including a pair of exterminators who detonate a bug bomb and leave him gasping in a cloud of poison. In one excruciating sequence, a disturbed friend answers his pleas for something to drink by pouring Cola in a trash can filled with God knows what. You do not want to know how his bodily excretions are handled.Sad and strange and defiantly gross, “Relaxer” is a surreal survival tale swirling with childhood trauma and Y2K paranoia. Few directors have as steely a grip on mental damage as Potrykus, and Burge, a regular collaborator, is his perfectly pained muse. Some may find this movie unbearable; yet there’s a place for pictures that push us to the limits of forbearance. Sometimes, even the loathsome have stories worth telling.Movie data powered by IMDb.comNot rated. Running time: 1 hour 31 minutes.Advertisement
