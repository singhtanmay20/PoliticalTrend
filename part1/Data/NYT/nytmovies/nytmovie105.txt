DC Comics movie starring Jason Momoa continued to lead ticket sales this weekend, taking in an estimated $30.7 million at the end of a lazy week at the box office. The movie, now in its third week in theaters, put a triumphant cap on Hollywood’s 2018 box office comeback. And it has continued to do well overseas, where it brought in $56.2 million this weekend according to the studio. Combined with its cumulative domestic sales, that brings the movie’s total global ticket sales to about $940.7 million, meaning it could soon surpass $1 billion.But while the staying power of “Aquaman” at the top spot points to the film’s continued success, it also points to the fact that there simply isn’t much competition during Hollywood’s post-holiday exhale.The only new movie in the top 10 this week, Sony’s “Escape Room,” exceeded most analysts’ expectations and landed in the No. 2 spot with $18 million in sales. A thriller directed by Adam Robitel, the film capitalized on the phenomenon of real-life “escape room” puzzle games, where players (or corporate employees on a team-building trip) are trapped in a room and have to complete a series of challenges to get out. “Escape Room” features a deadly version. While its opening weekend sales were modest beside those of “Aquaman,” the $18 million is a win for Sony given the movie’s $9 million budget.There are few surprises elsewhere in the top ten. Disney’s “Mary Poppins Returns” came in third with $15.8 million this weekend, while Sony’s well-received “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” came in fourth, making $13 million according to Comscore, which compiles box office data.Paramount’s “Bumblebee” rounded out the top five with $12.8 million. Sony’s “Holmes and Watson,” with Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly, solidifying its status as a flop during its second week in theaters, came in 10th with $3.4 million.Advertisement
