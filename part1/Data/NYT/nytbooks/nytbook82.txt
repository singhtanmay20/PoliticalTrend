Timothy Naftali, writing in The New York Times Book Review, called it “trenchant and timely,” adding that “the architects of America’s global engagement after World War II would have been appalled that future generations — let alone a future president — might think they had been acting in anything but the national interest.”In a statement, Mr. Steil, the director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations, echoed that point, indirectly linking his book to today’s debates about trade, global alliances and America’s place in the world.“It is ebbing from the national consciousness just what it was that made America great,” he said. “The creation, implementation and legacy of the Marshall Plan define its essence.”The award, named for the philanthropists Barbara and David Zalaznick, comes with a $50,000 award. Past winners include John A. Farrell, Jane Kamensky, Eric Foner and Jill Lepore.Mr. Steil will receive the prize on April 12 as part of the historical society’s Weekend with History, a private event.Follow Jennifer Schuessler on Twitter: @jennyschuessler.Follow New York Times Books on Facebook and Twitter (@nytimesbooks), sign up for our newsletter or our literary calendar.
