Yes, it's pretty hard to blow anyone's mind these days, including that of TV viewers, making truly gasp-worthy small-screen character deaths few and far between. But that didn't stop several showrunners from doing their worst -- er, best, to totally kill you with these on-screen passings. Obviously, spoilers ahead.Also Read: 18 Most-Watched TV Specials of 2018: Oscars, Emmys and Everyone Loves a Parade (Photos)Also Read: 18 Most-Watched TV Specials of 2018: Oscars, Emmys and Everyone Loves a Parade (Photos)Jack Pearson (Milo Ventimiglia) -- "This Is Us": We've known the Pearson family patriarch was going out long before the second season got around to showing how he died. The wham episode (which aired after the Super Bowl) packed a punch because of the twist that sees Jack of cardiac arrest due to smoke inhalation after a house fire the entire family manages to make it out of alive.Also Read: ‘This Is Us’ Finally Identifies Future Tess and Randall’s ‘Her’ on Fall FinaleAlso Read: ‘This Is Us’ Finally Identifies Future Tess and Randall’s ‘Her’ on Fall FinaleKanan (50 Cent) -- "Power"RIP Fitty.Also Read: ‘Power’ Crew Member Killed in On-Set Accident, Starz Series Shuts Down ProductionAlso Read: ‘Power’ Crew Member Killed in On-Set Accident, Starz Series Shuts Down ProductionMadison Clark (Kim Dickens) -- "Fear the Walking Dead": Madison's death was one of several bombs the "Walking Dead" franchise dropped on fans this year.

Yes, pretty much everyone kicking the bucket (at one point or another) by the end of "AHS" Season 8 was expected. But the real "OMG!" for Ryan Murphy fans came when the clock was turned back and (mostly) everyone on the good side of the end-of-days battle was revived, thanks to Mallory (Billie Lourd).Also Read: ‘American Horror Story’ Crossovers Continue?
