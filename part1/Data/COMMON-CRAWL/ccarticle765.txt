TheWrap Oscar Magazine: “It’s been amazing seeing how kids have embraced Miles,” Ramsey saysGetty Images; SonyA version of this story about Peter Ramsey appeared in the Down to the Wire issue of TheWrap’s Oscar magazine. For Peter Ramsey, it’s weird to think about the fact that he’s the first black director to be nominated for Best Animated Feature. But it’s nowhere near as weird as the fact that his film “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” has become such a big critical and audience hit that it is now the favorite to win an Oscar that has been dominated by Disney and Pixar over the past decade. “It’s been mind-blowing seeing how huge the reaction has been from everyone,” said Ramsey, who was driving back from a special screening of the Marvel movie at the Santa Barbara Film Festival. “There are times when I stop and wonder, ‘Are they really going crazy over the film that we worked on?'”Also Read: 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' Sweeps With Seven Wins at Annie AwardsIndeed they are, and even in the dominant superhero genre, “Spider-Verse” is a unique beast for reasons beyond its groundbreaking animation style. For even if characters like Iron Man and the Guardians of the Galaxy didn’t enjoy global notoriety until Marvel Studios turned them into movie icons, at least they had been a part of the comic book movie canon for decades. Not so with “Spider-Verse”‘s protagonist, Miles Morales, who was introduced a mere eight years ago after Peter Parker was shockingly killed off in Marvel’s “Ultimate Spider-Man” series. The announcement that the black, Hispanic Miles would take his place in the spinoff timeline earned cable news coverage and was met with grumblings of political correctness on more than a few internet message boards.But thanks to “Spider-Verse,” Miles is now a fully-fledged Spidey star, shining alongside the Wakandans as a symbol of blockbuster diversity. His multicultural background is displayed from the get-go as he heads to school with a hip-hop beat pumping and shouts out to his friends in both English and Spanish. While Peter Parker is the awkward nerd before becoming Spider-Man, Miles looks pretty comfortable in his own skin — at least until he’s pulled out of his element and sent to a charter school with a student body that’s much richer than him (and far less black).Also Read: 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse' Team on the High Tech Needed for the Hit Film's Lo-Fi Look
