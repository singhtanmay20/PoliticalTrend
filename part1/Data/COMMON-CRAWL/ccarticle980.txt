Since “The Lego Movie 2” is often a send-up of other franchise pictures, does it also lampoon post-credits scenes?Warner BrosIt’s been a long wait for the sequel to 2014’s “The Lego Movie,” with a pair of spinoffs — “The Lego Batman Movie” and “The Lego Ninjago Movie — coming before “The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part.” But it’s finally here and everything is awesome once again.Given that all of these movies are, to some extent, send-ups of other movie franchises — Batman’s entire thing in these movies is just cracking jokes about his portrayal in other movies — it wouldn’t be amiss to wonder if “The Lego Movie 2” follows in the footsteps of so many franchise pictures by including a scene after the credits to tease a future movie. Or just to make some additional jokes.I’ve actually got two answers to the question of whether “The Lego Movie 2” has a post-credits scene. First, and I guess most important: There are no additional scenes once the credits begin, no mid-credits scenes, no post-credits scenes, nothing. However, there is one very big reason to stick around for at least the first part of the credits: the song “Super Cool” by Beck, featuring Robyn and The Lonely Island.Also Read: 'The Lego Movie 2' Film Review: Colorful Sequel Clicks Into New Worlds of ImaginationYes, “The Lego Movie 2” has a new song that plays over the credits and it’s a doozie. At first it just seems like another fun and catchy song in the vein of “Everything Is Awesome” and the new “Catchy Song,” but then the Lonely Island verses kick in and we hear Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer and Jorma Taccone rap about how much the credits of a movie are the best part. It’s really something, and the perfect way for the movie to end.But that really is it. There are no extra scenes, just that song. So if you’re in a rush to get out of the theater you can head out knowing exactly what you are and aren’t missing. And if you did leave before the “Super Cool” song really ramped up, I have good news: Warner Bros has already put “Super Cool” on YouTube and you can listen to it right here.MEMBER CONTENTMEMBER CONTENTMEMBER CONTENTMEMBER CONTENT
