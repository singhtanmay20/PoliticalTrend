TBD on the identities of Bee, Rabbit, Lion, Peacock and Monster(Warning: This post contains spoilers for Wednesday’s episode of “The Masked Singer.”)Fox’s oddball, already-smash-hit celebrity singing game show “The Masked Singer” returned Wednesday, revealing at the end of its seventh episode that the identity of one of its famous contestants — who performed Elle King’s “Ex’ and Oh’s” disguised from head to toe in an elaborate Alien costume — was none other than La Toya Jackson.Tonight’s episode saw the return of Alien, Bee, Rabbit, Lion, Peacock and Monster.After the contestants performed, it was time for panelists Jenny McCarthy, Nicole Scherzinger, Ken Jeong and Robin Thicke, along with the studio audience, to choose which member of the group was the “weakest performer,” who would then be eliminated and unmasked. And that ended up being poor Alien.Also Read: 'The Masked Singer': Donnie Wahlberg Doesn't Say He's Not the Rabbit - We ThinkThen it was time for the booted celeb to unmask themselves, with Alien removing her giant head to reveal herself to be Jackson.According to Fox, between all of the 12 celebrities competing on the first season of “The Masked Singer,” they’ve amassed 65 Grammy nominations, 16 multi-platinum albums, 16 Emmy nominations, nine Broadway shows, four stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and four Super Bowl titles.Now, we still don’t know the identities of Bee, Rabbit, Lion, Peacock and Monster — though we have learned Ricki Lake was Raven, Tori Spelling was Unicorn, Margaret Cho was Poodle, Terry Bradshaw was Deer, Tommy Chong was Pineapple and Antonio Brown was Hippo.Also Read: 'The Masked Singer' Boss Tells Us No Panelist Ever Guessed Season 1 Winner's IdentityNext week, two of the remaining five celebs will be eliminated, leaving three to into the season finale.Watch the reveal above and Jackson’s performance below.When it comes to TV, winter is typically no fall -- but a few of these series premieres could have made the cut for an earlier start, ratings-wise. TheWrap has ranked all of broadcast's midseason debuts (so far) by their "live" total-viewer tallies. A pair of new singing competitions were impressive, a kinda-sorta reboot on The CW was not.
