“I have to acknowledge the lies, and the hate,” the “Empire” star tells “GMA” host Robin Roberts“Empire” star Jussie Smollett has given an emotional account of the night he says he was the victim of a racially motivated attack in Chicago, and said the doubters would probably have not questioned him if his attackers had been Muslim, Mexican or black.“I have to acknowledge the lies, and the hate,” he told “Good Morning America” in an interview with host Robin Roberts that aired on Thursday. “And it feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more. A lot more. And that says a lot about the place that we are in our country right now.”Smollett said the attack took place on Jan. 29 at 2 a.m., after the actor says that two men jumped him, yelling racial epithets while placing a rope around his neck. A police statement said unspecified chemicals were poured on the star’s face, and a rope placed around his neck.Also Read: Jussie Smollett Says He Gave Police Redacted Phone Records to 'Protect the Privacy of Personal Contacts'Chicago police have not made any arrests in the case and have issued statements seeking access to Smollett’s cellphone since he said he was on a call with his manager, Brandon Z.

(Video)Smollett addressed why he was initially reluctant to hand over the records, saying he did not want his private information in the hands of the police.“They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours. I’m sorry but — I’m not gonna do that,” he said. “Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers: my partner’s number, my family’s number, my castmate’s number, my friends’ numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos.”Richard Rodgers, composer (1902-1979)  Emmy: Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composed, "Winston Churchill: The Valiant Years" (1962)  Grammy: Best Show Album, "The Sound of Music" (1960);
