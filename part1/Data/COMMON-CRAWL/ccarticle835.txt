WWE biopic opened in Los Angeles and New York ahead of next weekend’s wide openingCourtesy: Sundance InstituteAfter premiering at Sundance in January, MGM/WWE Studios’ “Fighting With My Family” posted a solid four-screen opening in Los Angeles and New York at the indie box office ahead of its wide opening next weekend.Over the 3-day launch, the film earned $131,625 for a solid per screen average of $32,906. After Presidents’ Day, that total is expected to grow to $163,000 with a per screen average of $40,750.Directed by Stephen Merchant and produced by Dwayne Johnson — who also appears in the film as The Rock — the film stars Florence Pugh as Saraya “Paige” Bevis, a teen girl raised in a family of pro wrestlers in England.Paige would go on to become a three-time champion in WWE and the youngest person in the company’s history to earn a title belt, but first she had to fight her way through tryouts and training to become a star, and face the family conflict that came when her brother, Zak, failed to pass the tryouts and join WWE as well. Jack Lowden, Nick Frost, Lena Headey and Vince Vaughn also star in the film, which has a 92 percent Rotten Tomatoes score and is projected for a $7 million wide opening next weekend.Also releasing this weekend was the Bollywood import “Gully Boy,” which is estimated to earn a 4-day opening of $2.25 million from 260 screens for an average of $8,687. Premiering last weekend at the Berlin International Film Festival, “Gully Boy” stars Ranveer Singh as a boy from the slums of Mumbai who dreams of becoming a rap star. The film has a 100 percent Rotten Tomatoes score from 14 reviews, and has earned praise from Hollywood stars like Will Smith.Among holdovers, the Chinese blockbuster “The Wandering Earth” is estimated to add $1.7 million from 135 screens this weekend. That will bring the film’s U.S. total to $4.1 million, with a weekend per screen average of $12,787.Elsewhere, Focus Features’ “Everybody Knows” expanded to 23 screens in its second weekend and added $230,000 for a $10,000 average and a $325,000 total. Finally, the Warner Bros. WWI documentary “They Shall Not Grow Old” crossed the $15 million mark after nine weekends in theaters, grossing $1.18 million from 626 screens.Awkwafina, "The Farewell"Photographed by Irvin Rivera for TheWrapDemi Moore, "Corporate Animals"Photographed by Irvin Rivera for TheWrapEd Helms, "Corporate Animals"Photographed by Irvin Rivera for TheWrapHilary Swank, "I Am Mother"Photographed by Irvin Rivera for TheWrapClara Rugaard-Larsen, "I Am Mother"Photographed by Irvin Rivera for TheWrapDirector Grant Sputore, "I Am Mother"Photographed by Irvin Rivera for TheWrapDirector Sacha Jenkina and RZA, "Wu Tang Clan: Of Mics and Men"Photographed by Irvin Rivera for TheWrapPeter Sarsgaard, "The Sound of Silence"Photographed by Irvin Rivera for TheWrapTony Revolori, "The Sound of Silence"Photographed by Irvin Rivera for TheWrapComedian Reggie WattsPhotographed by Irvin Rivera for TheWrapZach Galifianakis, "The Sunlit Night"Photographed by Irvin Rivera for TheWrapJenny Slate, "The Sunlit Night"Photographed by Irvin Rivera for TheWrapStorm Reid, "Relive"Photographed by Irvin Rivera for TheWrapDavid Oyelowo, "Relive"Photographed by Irvin Rivera for TheWrapDirector Jacob Estes, "Relive"Photographed by Irvin Rivera for TheWrapJohn Lithgow, "The Tomorrow Man"Photographed by Irvin Rivera for TheWrapBlythe Danner, "The Tomorrow Man"Photographed by Irvin Rivera for TheWrapDirector Noble Jones, "The Tomorrow Man"Photographed by Irvin Rivera for TheWrapAnnette Bening, "The Report"Photographed by Irvin Rivera for TheWrapJon Hamm, "The Report"Photographed by Irvin Rivera for TheWrapMaura Tierney, "The Report"Photographed by Irvin Rivera for TheWrapDirector Scott Z.
