“The Americans” and “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” win awards for drama and comedy series; “Barry” wins the award for new seriesNicole Holofcener and Jeff Whitty’s “Can You Ever Forgive Me?” has been named the best adapted screenplay of 2018 by the Writers Guild of America, while Bo Burnham’s “Eighth Grade” was named the year’s best original screenplay in a surprising upset over Oscar Best Picture and screenplay nominees “Green Book,” “Roma” and “Vice.”“Eighth Grade” is not even nominated for the original-screenplay Oscar, making it the first WGA screenplay winner not to be nominated for the Oscar since Michael Moore’s “Bowling for Columbine” in 2003.While “Can You Ever Forgive Me?” is an Oscar screenplay nominee, it was not nominated for Best Picture and was competing against three films that had been nominated in that category — “Black Panther,” “BlacKkKlansman” and “A Star Is Born” — plus “If Beale Street Could Talk.”Also Read: 11 Best Movies of 2018, From 'Paddington 2' to 'Eighth Grade' (Photos)The results showed just how uncertain this year’s Oscars may well be, with all the prime contenders losing to smaller films in the last of the major guild awards.It also means that for the first time ever, the Writers Guild, Producers Guild, Directors Guild and Screen Actors Guild Awards produced five different winners, with no film winning more than one of those awards.(In 2013, a Producers Guild tie between “12 Years a Slave” and “Gravity” led to five different winners, but “Gravity” also won a second award, the DGA.)In the television categories, “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” continued its awards-show dominance by winning the WGA prize for best comedy series. “The Americans” won for drama series. In awards for individual episodes,  “Homeland” won for drama and “Barry” for comedy. “Barry” also won the award as the best new television series of the year.The long-form television awards went to “Castle Rock” and “The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story.”“Last Week Tonight With John Oliver” won the award for comedy/variety talk series, while “The Fake News with Ted Nelms” won the award for comedy/variety special. “Nathan for You” won the sketch series award in an upset over the favored “Saturday Night Live.”“Bathtubs Over Broadway” won for documentary screenplay, while TV documentary awards went to the “Trump’s Takeover” episode of “Frontline” and “The Eugenics Crusade” episode of “American Experience.”Also Read: How the Oscars Bungled This Year's Show So Badly, and Where the Academy Goes From HereSince the WGA adapted categories that match the Oscar writing categories in 1985, about two-thirds of Writers Guild winners have gone on to win the Oscar. While “Eighth Grade” cannot do that this year, “Can You Ever Forgive Me?” can.About half the time, one of the Writers Guild winners has also taken the Academy’s Best Picture prize, something that will be impossible at next Sunday’s Oscars.Honorary awards went to Jenji Kohan (the Paddy Chayevsky Laurel Award for Television Writing Achievement), Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel (Laurel Award for Screenwriting Achievement), Agnes Varda (Jean Renoir Award for International Screenwriting Achievement), Adam McKay (Paul Selvin Award), Joan Meyerson (Morgan Cox Award), Nicole Dubuc (AWC Animation Writing Award), Tom Fontana (Ian McLellan Hunter Award for Career Achievement) and Franklin Leonard (Evelyn F.
