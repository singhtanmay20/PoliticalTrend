Their attorney Gloria Schmidt did not immediately respond to calls for comment.Also Read: Fox Says Jussie Smollett Staying on 'Empire'; Chicago PD Rejects Hoax ReportsSmollett was hospitalized on Jan. 29, saying two men approached him on the streets of Chicago and beat him while shouting racist and homophobic slurs and referencing “MAGA.” According to a police statement, the actor reported that the two alleged attackers “batter[ed] the victim with their hands about the face and poured an unknown chemical substance” on him. Smollett also said the attackers wrapped a rope around his neck.The alleged attack itself was not captured on video, but police later shared surveillance footage of two men they identified as “persons of interest,” saying they were wanted for questioning in connection to the investigation.CBS Chicago later reported that police raided the home of the two men on Wednesday night and seized, among other things, “a black face mask hat, an Empire script, phone, receipts, a red hat and bleach.” According to the report, police took the men into custody at O’Hare International Airport as they returned from a trip to Nigeria.Also Read: Chicago PD Identifies Persons of Interest in Jussie Smollett Attack Investigation“The people of interest are alleged to be in the area where a crime was reported,” Gugliemi, the Chicago Police Department spokesperson, said at the time. “They are not considered suspects at this time as they are currently being questioned by detectives. We remain in communication with the alleged victim.”In his first public interview since the incident, a sit-down with Robin Roberts on “Good Morning America” on Wednesday, Smollett said he was certain the two men in the surveillance footage were the men who attacked him.“I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them,” he said. “Never did.”Also Read: Jussie Smollett Has Been 'Doubly Victimized' by 'Media Industry and Broader Culture,' GLAAD SaysSmollett also pushed back on those who have questioned his account of the incident, saying that he was “pissed off” at what he called “attacks” from those who may have doubted his account. “Listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it, ’cause it’s the truth,” he told Roberts.Police have said that Smollett continues to be considered a victim in relation to the investigation, contesting two recent news reports saying investigators have raised the possibility that Smollett may have orchestrated the attack himself.“Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,” Chicago PD tweeted Thursday. “Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”Ellen DeGeneres, talk show host, actress and comedianJodie Foster, Oscar-winning actress and directorZachary Quinto, actor and producer ("Star Trek")Neil Patrick Harris, former "How I Met Your Mother" actorRobin Roberts, "Good Morning America" anchorJane Lynch, former "Glee" actress and "Hollywood Game Night" hostJim Parsons, Emmy-winning actor in  "The Big Bang Theory"Raven-Symoné, former "That's So Raven" starGuillermo Diaz, actor ("Scandal")Maria Bello, "Prisoners" actressSarah Paulson, star of "American Horror Story"Matt Bomer, actor ("White Collar," "American Horror Story")Cynthia Nixon, former "Sex and the City" actressKristen Stewart, actress ("Twilight" series)Holland Taylor, former "Two and a Half Men" actressAdam Lambert, singer and "American Idol" alumElton John, singerSara Gilbert, former "Roseanne" actress and co-host of "The Talk"Cheyenne Jackson, actor ("30 Rock," "American Horror Story")Colton Haynes, actor ("Teen Wolf," "Arrow")Ellen Page, actress ("X-Men," "Juno")Ben Whishaw, actor ("Spectre")Wanda Sykes, actress and comedianWentworth Miller, "Prison Break" starRosie O'Donnell, actress and former talk show hostPortia De Rossi, actress ("Scandal," "Arrested Development")Ricky Martin, singerLily Tomlin, comedian and actress ("Grace & Frankie")Sam Smith, Oscar-winning singer and songwriterJesse Tyler Ferguson, "Modern Family" actorLaverne Cox, "Orange Is the New Black" starMeredith Baxter, "Family Ties" actressBarry Manilow, singerAmandla Stenberg, actress ("Everything Everything")Darren Young, WWE superstarDaniela Vega, actress ("A Fantastic Woman")George Takei, former "Star Trek" actorEzra Miller, "Justice League" actorJillian Michaels, "The Biggest Loser" coachIan McKellen, actor in "The Lord of the Rings" and "X-Men" franchisesSean Hayes, actor in "Will and Grace"From actress Jane Lynch to actor Zachary Quinto to talk show host Ellen DeGeneres, stars who serve as inspirations for Pride Month
