“I wisely started with a map” — J.R.R. TolkienNew Line CinemaAmazon has released one map to rule them all.The official Twitter account for Prime Video’s upcoming “The Lord of the Rings” TV series shared a link to a map of J.R.R. Tolkien’s fictional Middle-earth on Friday morning.And seeing as this map appears to tease what the world in Amazon’s small-screen adaptation of the franchise looks like, it’s definitely giving “LOTR” fans enough material to obsess over all weekend long.Also Read: 'Lord of The Rings': 'Star Trek 4' Duo JD Payne and Patrick McKay to Develop Series for AmazonDetails about Amazon’s “LOTR” series — which first announced in November 2017 and is being developed by “Star Trek 4” duo JD Payne and Patrick McKay — are still scarce. But we do know the show is set in Middle-earth and will explore stories that precede the events of Tolkein’s “The Fellowship of the Ring.”Amazon Studios has a multi-season commitment for the series, and the deal also includes a potential spin-off series. The new “LOTR” series will be produced in cooperation with the Tolkein Estate and Trust, HarperCollins and New Line Cinema, a division of Warner Bros. Entertainment.And though we were hoping to have some new info for you after the streamer took the stage at the Television Critics Association press tour earlier this week, Amazon Studios head Jen Salke had no updates to report on the project — including a timetable for production/launch.Also Read: 13 TCA Takeaways: 'AHS' Deets, Why Kenya Barris Bailed on ABC, and Just What Is Going on at CBS?But she did announce the show’s official social media handles — so you may wanna keep your eye on this Twitter account from now on.See the first three tweets from Prime Video’s “LOTR” series’ official account below and check out their map of Middle-earth here.“I wisely started with a map” — J.R.R.
