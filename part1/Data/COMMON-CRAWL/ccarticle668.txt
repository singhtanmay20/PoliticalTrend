Their attorney, Gloria Schmidt, did not respond to requests for comment.Smollett was hospitalized on Jan. 29, and reported to police that he was assaulted near his Chicago home by two men who shouted racist and homophobic slurs and referenced “MAGA.” According to a police statement, the actor reported that he was battered “about the face,” that “an unknown chemical substance” was poured on him, and that the attackers wrapped a rope around his neck.Police later shared surveillance footage of two men they identified as “persons of interest.”Also Read: How the Oscars Bungled This Year's Show So Badly, and Where the Academy Goes From HereIn his first public interview since the incident, Smollett told “Good Morning America” anchor Robin Roberts on Wednesday that he was certain the two men in the surveillance footage were the men who attacked him.“I don’t have any doubt in my mind that that’s them,” he said. “Never did.”Smollett also pushed back against people who have questioned his account of the attack, telling Roberts: “Listen, if I tell the truth then that’s it, ’cause it’s the truth.”Police have said that Smollett continues to be considered a victim in relation to the investigation, contesting two recent news reports saying investigators have raised the possibility that Smollett may have orchestrated the attack himself.“Media reports about the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives,” Chicago police tweeted Thursday. “Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate.”The ninth annual espnW: Women + Sports Summit kicked off at the Pelican Hill Resort in Newport Beach, California, on Monday, where the biggest names in sports, business and media tackled difficult topics from sexual abuse, gender equality and creating opportunities for athletes with special needs.On Monday afternoon, Danica Patrick told Hannah Storm how she's become a "small business owner" since retiring from professional motor racing earlier this year. ESPN's Hannah Storm interviewed 2018 ESPYs host, NASCAR and IndyCar champion, Danica Patrick.Nine-time host Sage Steele opened the espnW Summit Monday afternoon. Olympic gold medalists Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson, Hilary Knight, Meghan Duggan and Kendall Coyne Schofield talked with Julie Foudy about standing up to the International Ice Hockey Federation in their fight for equality. Beth Mowins, Doris Burke, Sage Steele, Sam Ponder and Maria Taylor join forces for "Breaking Barriers in Sports Media" panel.Connor Schell, ESPN executive vice president, content, laughed and swapped notes with Sage Steele ahead of the "Breaking Barriers in Sports Media" panel.Grammy-nominated singer Andra Day talked to espnW's "Be Honest" host and "SportsCenter" co-anchor Cari Champion about her empowering hit song "Rise Up," which became the anthem for the week.Andra Day got the crowd in on the action as they surged the stage to close out her intimate performance on Monday night. "SportsCenter" co-anchor Cari Champion presented her signature "Be Honest" segment.Maverick Carter proved he's so much more than LeBron James' best friend and manager when he detailed their growing entertainment empire.
